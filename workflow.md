# Workflow

- In every appointment, we check the PR of the last week was merged
- Your new branch will be created. -> `git checkout -b "week-$(date +%V)"`
- Go through the "Nextup" list on the Trello Board
- discuss adding to the README.md afterwards
- At the end of the appointment a new PR will be created
