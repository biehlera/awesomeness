# Workflow
- In every appointment we check whether the pullrequest of the last week was merged, if I will do it now at the latest.
- Your new branch will be created. -> `git checkout -b "week-$(date +%V)"`
- Go through the "Nextup" list on the Trello and discuss adding to the README.md afterwards
- At the end of the appointment a PR will be created
